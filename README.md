This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in COBOL related to numeric data handling within an IF statement.  The original code contains a logical error that may not be immediately obvious. The solution shows how to correct this error and improve the code's clarity and reliability.  The issue highlights the importance of carefully considering data types and conditional logic when programming in COBOL.
